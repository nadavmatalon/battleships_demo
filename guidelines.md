<h3>Task:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The task is to write a web based battleship game in sinatra using your knowledge and googling skills</li>
	<li>When a potential player goes to the website the player will be prompted for a name to register for a new game (only if there are less than two players already registered).</li>
	<li>Once registered you will be able to place your ships (you will need to show a grid and allow the players to place their ships on it; the types and numbers of ships allowed are the same for each player).</li>
	<li>After the ships have been positioned, the game proceeds in a series of rounds. In each round, each player takes a turn to announce a target square in the opponent's grid which is to be shot at. The opponent announces whether or not the square is occupied by a ship, and if it is a "hit" they mark this on their own primary grid. The attacking player notes the hit or miss on their own "tracking" grid, in order to build up a picture of the opponent's fleet.</li>
	<li>When all of the squares of a ship have been hit, the ship is sunk, and the ship's owner announces this (e.g. "You sank my battleship!"). If all of a player's ships have been sunk, the game is over and their opponent wins.</li>
	<li>You will get extra credit if the game looks beautiful).</li>
	<li>If you want a challenge over the challenge (we havenâ€™t covered any of this): Deploy your sinatra application on heroku</li>
